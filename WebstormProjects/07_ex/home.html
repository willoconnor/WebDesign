<h1 class="main-headline emphasis">Hello World!</h1>
<h2 class="secondary">A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p class="place-description">I would love to visit Scotland. The mountains and rock formations of Scotland are
    said to be breathtaking. I'm also really interested by historic castles; Scotland has
plenty of these, as well as many old ruins I'd love to explore. The combination of weathered
rock and lush green grass sounds ideal to me: if it were raining as well, I'd be totally content. </p>

<h2 class="secondary">A person I admire (past or present)</h2>
<p class="person-description">Someone I really admire is Vito Mannone. He's the keeper for Minnesota United FC this year
    Vito is an Italian player who had played in Europe for his whole career up until this year,
    and yet he has quickly assimilated into life in Minnesota and become a fan favorite. He's a
    strong leader for our team, and has been named <span class="important-point">Man of the Match</span> countless times for his
    consistent work ethic. After almost every win, he walks a slow lap around the entire field
    clapping his hands for the fans, which I think is really classy and shows how much he cares
    about this team and its fan base. I was lucky enough to meet Vito and get his autograph at
    the State Fair this year; he's even taller up close!
