<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p>I would love to visit India. A good friend of mine lives in Bangalore,
and he often talks about the sunny weather and unique architecture. He
has told me that he wants me to come to India and visit the Taj Mahal with him,
    since he's never been there before. That makes two of us! </p>
<h2>A person I admire</h2>
<p>I admire my older brother Ryan. He just graduated from college last spring,
and is now working with a prominent technology company. Ryan is a very hard
worker, and always comes off as a very organized person.</p>
<h2>Favorite fruits</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Grapes</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Peaches</li>
